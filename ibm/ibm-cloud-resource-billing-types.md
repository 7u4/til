# IBM billing types

## Overview
This document explains how IBM charges amount for allocated resource and resource creation strategies.

## Details
There are two ways in which IBM charges amount for resource


1- `Hourly`: In this policy resoures will be charged on hourly basis. It is useful for testing purpose because during testing resources are created and deleted frequently.

2- `Monthly`: In this policy resources will be charged on monthly basis. It must be used when we want to persist the data for a long period otherwise if resource is delete before the expiry time then the amount will be charged for the whole month instead for the period of time it was used.
