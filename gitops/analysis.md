# GitOps analysis

## Tools
* [ArgoCD analysis](gitops/argocd.md)
* [Weave Flux analysis](gitops/workflow.md)

## Conclusion thus far
ArgoCD is way more production ready due to stability and features than Flux.
For the feature shortcomings that we feel must be implemented before adoption, we should implement ourselves on top of ArgoCD.
