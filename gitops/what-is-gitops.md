## What is GitOps

GitOps is all about turning day 2 operations into code! Not just that, it means you start thinking about day 2 on day 1. This is a dream come true for any Operations team! GitOps leverages the strength of automation and combines it with the power of git based workflows. It is a natural evolution beyond infrastructure-as-code and builds on top of DevOps best practices.

### Next Generation Change Management

Especially in large Enterprises, Change Management is usually a painful experience. GitOps allows to take a lot of that pain out and streamline the process itself. It does so by still providing what the process tries to accomplish (and thus still meet audit requirements), but does so in a way that is much faster, much more secure, and much more reliable.

Your changes now all of a sudden provide:

- Version Control
- Peer Reviews
- Approvals
- Audit Trail
- Reproducibility
- Consistency
- Reliability

What's your backout plan for your change? How about simply moving back to the previous commit and getting EXACTLY what you had before?
