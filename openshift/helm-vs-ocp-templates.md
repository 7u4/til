# Helm vs Openshift Templates

The following table shows how Helm and Openshift Templates differ:

| Openshift Templates                                                                                                               | Helm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All resource objects reside in a single template (1 file per template)                                                            | Can split resources in different files as needed to reduce clutter                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Managed by openshift                                                                                                              | Needs a third party tool to manage (Helm and tiller)                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Templating is controlled via env variables (Defined inside the same template file)                                                | A separate values.yaml file which can be overridden per deploy                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Lack of readability and manageability since everything is going to be in a single file                                            | Easier to manage and you can focus on 1 resource at a time                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Cannot use control structures like if, for. It means you can’t really templatize the resources except for just the values         | Provides a templating engine with a lot of features such as control structures, ability to check which API is present on the server and control resources based on that, possible creation of functions that reduces redundancy in the resources |
| If the template is modified, then the whole application needs to be teardown and redeployed in order for the new template to work | Can do rolling upgrades just fine when you add / remove resources or just change the template values                                                                                                                                             |
| No exactly sure how it works under the hood but is rarely updated with new openshift versions                                     | Well managed and continuously improved by the community                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| No support for dependencies between templates                                                                                     | Supports dependencies between helm charts with the concept of sub-charts                                                                                                                                                                         |
| More secure since the templates are deployed by openshift itself                                                                  | Tiller (Helm server) needs to have RBAC permissions for it to be able to deploy templates (Won’t be an issue with helm 3); Also OpenShift themselves have lots of blogs on how to use Helm; which means they do like it as well.                                                                                                                        |
