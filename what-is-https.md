When you access a web site using the HTTPS protocol, a whole lot of interesting work (formally known as an SSL/TLS handshake) happens to create and maintain a secure communication channel. Your client (browser) and the web server work together to negotiate a mutually agreeable cipher, exchange keys, and set up a session key. Once established, both ends of the conversation use the session key to encrypt and decrypt all further traffic. Because the session key is unique to the conversation between the client and the server, a third party cannot decrypt the traffic or interfere with the conversation.
